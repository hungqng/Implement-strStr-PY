# 28. Implement strStr()
# Implement strStr().

# Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

# Clarification:

# What should we return when needle is an empty string? This is a great question to ask during an interview.

# For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when needle is an empty string. This is consistent to C's strstr() and Java's indexOf().

class Solution:
    def strStr(self, haystack: str, needle: str) -> int:
        if needle == "":
            return 0
        for i in range(len(haystack) + 1 - len(needle)):
            if haystack[i: i + len(needle)] == needle:
                return i
        return -1
